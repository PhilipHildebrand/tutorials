## Setup

We solve a partitioned heat equation. For information on the non-partitioned case, please refer to [1, p.37ff]. In this tutorial the computational domain is partitioned and coupled via preCICE. The coupling roughly follows the approach described in [2].

Case setup from [3]. `D` denotes the Dirichlet participant and `N` denotes the Neumann participant.

The heat equation is solved on a rectangular domain `Omega = [0,2] x [0,1]` with given Dirichlet boundary conditions. We split the domain at `x_c = 1` using a straight vertical line, the coupling interface. The left part of the domain will be referred to as the Dirichlet partition and the right part as the Neumann partition. To couple the two participants we use Dirichlet-Neumann coupling. Here, the Dirichlet participant receives Dirichlet boundary conditions (`Temperature`) at the coupling interface and solves the heat equation using these boundary conditions on the left part of the domain. Then the Dirichlet participant computes the resulting heat flux (`Flux`) from the solution and sends it to the Neumann participant. The Neumann participant uses the flux as a Neumann boundary condition to solve the heat equation on the right part of the domain. We then extract the temperature from the solution and send it back to the Dirichlet participant. This establishes the coupling between the two participants.

This simple case allows us to compare the solution for the partitioned case to a known analytical solution (method of manufactures solutions, see [1, p.37ff]). For more usage examples and details, please refer to [3, sect. 4.1].

## Available solvers and dependencies

You need to couple the FEniCSx solver with itself. You will also need to have preCICE and the python bindings installed on your system.

* FEniCSx. Install [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/download/) and the [FEniCSx-adapter](https://github.com/precice/fenicsx-adapter). The code is largely based on this [fenics-tutorial](https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-tutorial/blob/master/pub/python/vol1/ft03_heat.py) from [1] and adapted to FEniCSx.

## Running the simulation

This tutorial is for FEniCSx. You can find the corresponding `run.sh` script in the folder `fenicsx`.

For choosing whether you want to run the Dirichlet-kind and a Neumann-kind participant, please provide the following commandline input:

* `-d` flag will enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions on the coupling interface.
* `-n` flag will enforce Neumann boundary conditions on the coupling interface.

For running the case, open two terminals run:

```bash
cd fenicsx
./run.sh -d
```

and

```bash
cd fenicsx
./run.sh -n
```

## Visualization

Output is written into the folder `fenicsx/out`.

For FEniCS you can visualize the content with paraview by opening the `*.xdmf` files. The files `Dirichlet.xdmf` and `Neumann.xdmf` correspond to the numerical solution of the Dirichlet, respectively Neumann, problem.
